Tower Engineering Constants — India Transmission Sector
Purpose

Define engineering and structural assumptions required for estimating transmission tower manufacturing demand from EPC line construction projects.

These constants must be used when estimating:

Towers per km

MT per tower

Captive tower tonnage

Manufacturing plant utilization

These values reflect typical ranges in Indian transmission projects.

Towers per km by Voltage Class
Voltage Class	Towers per km
132 kV	5.5
220 kV	4.5
400 kV	3.5
765 kV	2.7
±800 kV HVDC	2.3

Use midpoint values unless project-specific design data is available.

Tower Weight (MT) by Voltage Class
Voltage Class	MT per Tower
132 kV	6 – 8 MT
220 kV	10 – 14 MT
400 kV	20 – 28 MT
765 kV	35 – 45 MT
±800 kV HVDC	50 – 70 MT

Use midpoint for base case estimation.

Use upper bound for conservative utilization scenario.

Derived Captive Demand Calculation

For each EPC project:

Annual Tower Demand (MT) =

Project Length (km)
× Towers per km
× MT per tower

Aggregate across EPC pipeline to derive:

Annual Captive Tower Demand (MT)

Plant Utilization Estimate

Utilization (%) =

Captive Tower Demand (MT)
÷ Installed Plant Capacity (MTPA)

Apply to:

50,000 MTPA plant

125,000 MTPA plant

250,000 MTPA plant

Usage Rules

Use captive EPC-derived demand as:

Primary driver of initial plant sizing
Primary justification for staged capex deployment

Do NOT size plant based solely on:

Market TAM

External demand projections

Sensitivity Guidance

Test plant viability under:

Lower bound MT per tower

Approval delay scenarios

Reduced EPC pipeline utilization
