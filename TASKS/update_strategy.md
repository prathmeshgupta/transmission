TASK: Update Transmission Diversification Strategy Note
Objective

Evaluate diversification opportunities for a large Indian transmission EPC company (>Rs 5,000 Cr annual revenue) into transmission manufacturing segments.

Update and improve the advisory note using:

EPC captive demand estimation

Manufacturing utilization modelling

Staged capex investment pathways

Vendor qualification timelines

Commodity sensitivity analysis

The output must support Board-level investment decision making.

Step 1 — Document Ingestion

Read the following files from /data:

Summary note on transmission

Transmission market research dump

Transmission industry notes

Any EPC orderbook / project pipeline documents (if available)

Extract:

EPC project km by voltage class

Segment exposure (132kV / 220kV / 400kV / 765kV)

Line construction pipeline timing

Step 2 — Captive Demand Estimation

For transmission tower manufacturing:

Estimate:

Towers per km by voltage class

MT per tower by voltage class

Annual tower MT requirement based on EPC project pipeline

Calculate:

Annual Captive Tower Demand (MT)

Use captive demand to estimate:

Achievable plant utilization

Utilization in Years 1–3 post commissioning

Step 3 — Plant Viability Scenarios

Evaluate plant scale options:

50,000 MTPA

125,000 MTPA

250,000 MTPA

For each scenario:

Estimate:

Year 1–3 utilization

Break-even utilization

Project IRR

Payback period

EPC margin uplift

Captive utilization must be evaluated as primary viability driver.

Step 4 — Approval Timeline Simulation

Account for:

PowerGrid vendor qualification

STU approval pathway

Manufacturing ramp-up risk

Model:

Approval delay scenarios:

12 months

18 months

24 months

Treat approval delay as revenue-start lag.

Captive EPC supply may be considered during approval period where feasible.

Step 5 — Commodity Sensitivity

Evaluate financial impact under:

Steel price +20%

Steel price –20%

Zinc price +20%

Zinc price –20%

Also test:

Utilization at 50%

Utilization at 75%

Utilization at 90%

Report IRR sensitivity to:

Commodity input cost

Utilization

Approval delay

Step 6 — Strategic Evaluation

Compare diversification options:

Tower manufacturing

Commodity conductor manufacturing

HTLS conductor licensing

Insulator manufacturing

Transformer manufacturing

Exclude:

Manufacturing entry based solely on TAM growth

First-stage transformer manufacturing

Conductor manufacturing without differentiation

Step 7 — Decision Gate

Determine:

Go / No-Go decision thresholds based on:

IRR

Payback

Utilization

Approval timeline risk

Step 8 — Output Generation

Generate updated advisory memo in:

/outputs/AdvisoryNote_vNext.md

Memo must include:

Strategic recommendation

Captive demand estimation

Plant scale scenarios

Financial modelling

Approval timelines

Risk matrix

Go / No-Go thresholds

Implementation roadmap (18–36 months)
